1. Variables in JavaScript:
Variables in JavaScript are used to store and manage data within a program. They act as containers that can hold different types of information, such as numbers, text, or objects. Variables provide a way to access, manipulate, and work with data in your code.

2. Declaring a Variable:
To declare a variable in JavaScript means to create a named storage location for data. It involves specifying the variable's name and, optionally, its initial value and type. You declare a variable using one of the following keywords: var, let, or const.

3. Assignment Operator:
Represented by =; used to assign a value to a variable.

4. Information Received from the User:
Information received from the user is typically referred to as "user input" or "user-generated data." 

    The user is prompted to enter their name, and the input is stored in the userInput variable :

    let userInput = prompt("Enter your **name:");**
