## What is HTML and why do we use it?
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standardized markup language used for creating web pages. It's the foundation of web content and structures the elements on a webpage. HTML is used to define the structure and layout of web content, including text, images, links, forms, and more. It provides a way to format and organize information, making it visually appealing and accessible to users across different devices and browsers.

## What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?
An HTML element has three main parts:

- Opening Tag: This is the beginning of the element and is enclosed in angle brackets. It specifies the element's name, like <p> for a paragraph.
- Content: This is the actual content that the element encloses, like text, images, or other elements.
- Closing Tag: This marks the end of the element and is also enclosed in angle brackets, but it includes a forward slash before the element name, like </p> for closing a paragraph.

## hat is it called when you give an element extra information?
When you provide extra information about an element, you're adding attributes to that element. Attributes are used to modify or provide additional details about an HTML element. For example, in the element <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">, "src" and "alt" are attributes that provide extra information about the image element.

## What is a semantic element?
A semantic element in HTML is an element that carries meaning or defines the structure of web content in a way that is both human-readable and machine-readable. Semantic elements are used to provide context and convey the intended purpose of the content they enclose. Examples of semantic elements include <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer. Using semantic elements helps improve the accessibility, SEO, and overall clarity of web documents.
