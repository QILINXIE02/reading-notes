**Features of text editor:** 
1. Syntax Highlighting: highlights different elements of your code or text with different colors, making it easier to read and understand the code's structure. It improves code readability and reduces errors.
2. Auto-Completion: Auto-completion suggests code or word completions as you type, saving time and avoiding typos and mistakes.
3. Multi-Cursor Support: places multiple cursors in the text at once, enabling you to edit or delete multiple lines simultaneously. It's useful for tasks like renaming -variables or making similar changes throughout a document.
4. Extensions and Plugins: it customizes the editor to suit specific needs

-------------------------------------------

The `pwd` command stands for "print working directory". It displays the current directory path on the command line.

The `ls` command is used to list files and directories in the current directory.

The `cd` command is used to change the current directory.

The `mkdir` command stands for "create directory". It is used to create a new directory (folder) whose name is provided as argument.

The `touch` command creates an empty file whose name is provided as an argument.

----------------------------------------------------

### Scenarios
cd projects: This command changes the current directory to the "projects" directory.
mkdir new-project: This command creates a new directory named "new-project" inside the "projects" directory.
touch new-project/newfile.md: This command creates a new empty file named "newfile.md" inside the "new-project" directory.
cd ..: This command moves one directory up from the current directory, effectively going back to the parent directory of "projects."
ls projects/new-project: This command lists the contents of the "new-project" directory, which should display the "newfile.md" file if the previous commands were successful.

**These commands and arguments have resulted in the creation of a new directory named "new-project" inside the "projects" directory and the creation of an empty file named "newfile.md" inside the "new-project" directory. Finally, it lists the contents of the "new-project" directory to confirm the presence of the "newfile.md" file.**
