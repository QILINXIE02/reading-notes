# Markdown-explained
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is commonly used to format and style plain text. It was created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004. Markdown allows you to add formatting elements to plain text documents using simple and easy-to-read syntax. It is often used for creating documents, web content, README files, and other types of structured text.

**Why do we use Markdown?**:
-It provides a simple way to format text without the complexity of HTML or other markup languages.
-It's widely supported and can be converted into HTML or other formats.

## **Lesson on headings:**
In Markdown, the headings hashtag "#" symbols creat heading for you. The number of "#" symbols you use determines the heading level. For example:

# creates a first-level heading.

## creates a second-level heading.
### creates a third-level heading.
...
###### the 6th heading is the samllest

When making text bold for emphasis, it is best practice to use double asterisks (**) or double underscores (__). 
You can manually type in **bold text** or __bold text__. Alternatively, use your keyboard shortcut **Control+B** on Window systems.

When making text italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use single asterisks (*) or single underscores (_). 
You can manually type in *italicized text* or _italicized text_. Alternatively, use your keyboard shortcut _Control+I_ on Window systems.

## **Lesson on creating links**: 
The format is : [Link text](URL)
Link text is the text you want to display as the link. Put [] around it, 
Right next to it with no space use () to paste the URL web address for your link. 

## **Lesson on symbols for bulleted list**:
Asterisk *, Plus +, Minus -

For example : when you put * Monday, it becomes this:
* Monday

tip: remember to have a space between the word "Monday" and your symbol *, or otherwise it won't be bulleted
