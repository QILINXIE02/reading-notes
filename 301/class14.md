# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## Reading: Consider the history and importance of diversity

### That Time When Women Stopped Coding

- **What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?**
  The decline of women in computer science began around the mid-1980s, coinciding with the marketing of personal computers predominantly towards males. This period saw personal computers being more common in homes, but they were often marketed and geared towards boys, creating a gender bias in early exposure to computing.

- **Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**
  The early exposure of males to computers, both in terms of societal encouragement and marketing strategies, contributed to a gender gap in computer science. It matters because this early familiarity and comfort with computers gave males a significant advantage in computer science courses and careers, perpetuating the notion that computing was predominantly a male domain.

### Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

- **When are diversity efforts most successful?**
  Diversity efforts are most successful when they are a genuine, integral part of the company culture, rather than a checkbox or a PR move. This means committing to diversity at all levels of the organization, from hiring and retention practices to leadership and decision-making roles.

- **Why do diverse companies perform better?**
  Diverse companies perform better because they benefit from a wider range of perspectives, ideas, and experiences. This diversity fosters creativity and innovation, enables better problem-solving, and can even lead to products and services that are more inclusive and appealing to a broader customer base. Additionally, diverse companies are better equipped to understand and navigate global markets.

- **Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**
  A diverse company, with employees who have different backgrounds, cultures, and experiences, is more likely to design and develop products that cater to a wide variety of needs and preferences. For example, a tech company with a diverse team might be more adept at creating software that is accessible to people with disabilities, supports multiple languages, and is sensitive to cultural nuances, thereby serving a diverse user base more effectively.

## Things I Want to Know More About

I'm interested in learning more about effective strategies for improving diversity and inclusion within tech companies, particularly in the context of recruitment and career advancement.
