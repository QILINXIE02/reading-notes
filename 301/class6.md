# Understanding Team Dynamics and REST Principles

### What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

1. **To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience?**
   Psychological safety has played a crucial role in my previous work experiences. In environments where it was present, I felt more open to sharing ideas, admitting mistakes, and collaborating closely with teammates. Conversely, in its absence, there was a noticeable tension, reduced innovation, and hesitancy to fully engage or take risks, impacting the team's overall effectiveness and morale.

2. **How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward?**
   This article reinforces the importance of fostering an environment of psychological safety within teams. Moving forward, I aim to contribute more actively to creating such an environment by encouraging open communication, showing empathy, actively listening to my teammates, and ensuring that everyone feels valued and respected. This approach will not only enhance team collaboration but also drive collective success and innovation.

### How I explained REST to my brother

1. **Who is Roy Fielding?**
   Roy Fielding is a computer scientist who played a significant role in the development of the HTTP protocol and the World Wide Web. He is best known for his doctoral dissertation, which introduced the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style.

2. **Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**
   The techniques we use in this class are designed for specific, often isolated applications and may not adhere to the universal standards necessary for global machine-to-machine communication. REST, as proposed by Fielding, provides a more standardized approach allowing diverse systems to communicate more efficiently and effectively through well-defined operations over the web.

3. **What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**
   The HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a foundational protocol for the web developed by Fielding and his colleagues. It facilitates communication between clients and servers, allowing the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. It is a stateless protocol that operates through request-response pairs between clients and servers.

4. **What does a GET do?**
   A GET request is used to retrieve data from a server at the specified resource. It requests a representation of the specified resource and should only retrieve data without causing any other effect.

5. **What does a POST do?**
   A POST request is used to send data to the server to create or update a resource. It is often used when submitting form data or uploading a file.

6. **What does PUT do?**
   A PUT request replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload. It is used to update or create a resource at a specific URI, assuming the client has permission to do so.

7. **What does PATCH do?**
   A PATCH request is used for making partial updates to an existing resource. Unlike PUT, PATCH applies a partial update to the resource, only modifying the specified fields.

## Things I Want to Know More About

I'm interested in learning more about the practical applications of psychological safety in diverse team settings, particularly in remote or hybrid work environments. Additionally, I would like to explore further how REST principles can be applied to designing scalable and efficient APIs for complex systems. Understanding these topics in greater depth will enhance my ability to contribute effectively to team projects and develop robust web applications.
