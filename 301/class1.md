# Class 01: React and Components Note

### Component-Based Architecture

**Definition of a Component:** In the context of web development and React, a component is a reusable, self-contained unit that represents a specific piece of a user interface (UI). Components can range from simple, like a button, to complex, like an entire form or page.

**Characteristics of a Component:**
- **Reusability:** Components can be reused across different parts of an application.
- **Encapsulation:** Components encapsulate their own functionality and do not interfere with the rest of the application.
- **Modularity:** Components can be developed and maintained independently.

**Advantages of Component-Based Architecture:**
- **Reusability:** Components can be reused, reducing development time.
- **Maintenance:** Components are modular and encapsulated, making them easier to maintain.
- **Collaboration:** Different teams or developers can work on different components simultaneously.

### Props in React

**What is "Props" Short For?:** "Props" is short for properties. In React, props are used for passing data from one component to another.

**How are Props Used in React?:** Props are passed to a component as attributes and can be accessed within the component. They allow data to be passed down the component tree. Data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow (one way from parent to child).

**Flow of Props:**
- **Parent Component:** Props are defined in the parent component.
- **Child Component:** Props are passed to the child component.
- **Child Component Usage:** The child component receives and uses the props.
