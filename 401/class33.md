## What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security model that restricts system access to authorized users based on their roles within an organization. In RBAC, permissions are associated with roles, and users are assigned to one or more roles. This approach simplifies access management by grouping users with similar permissions under common roles, making it easier to enforce security policies and manage user access rights.

### Example of RBAC:

Consider a web application with the following roles and their corresponding permissions:
- **Admin**: Can perform all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on all resources.
- **Editor**: Can create, read, and update resources, but cannot delete them.
- **Viewer**: Can only read resources but cannot perform any modification operations.

### Benefits of RBAC:

- **Simplified Access Management**: RBAC streamlines the process of managing user access rights by organizing users into roles and assigning permissions based on these roles.
- **Granular Control**: RBAC allows administrators to assign fine-grained permissions to roles, ensuring that users have access only to the resources and actions necessary for their job roles.
- **Scalability**: RBAC scales well with growing organizations as new roles can be easily defined, and users can be assigned to multiple roles as needed.

## Compare and Contrast react-cookie and react-cookies

### react-cookie library:
- **Features**:
  - Lightweight and easy-to-use library for handling browser cookies in React applications.
  - Provides simple APIs for setting, getting, and removing cookies.
  - Supports server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side storage.

### react-cookies component:
- **Features**:
  - Another library for managing cookies in React applications.
  - Offers similar functionality to react-cookie but with a slightly different API.
  - Supports cookie expiration and path configuration.

### Preference:
I would prefer using the `react-cookie` library due to its simplicity and ease of use. It offers a straightforward API for cookie management, which aligns well with the typical requirements of handling cookies in React applications. Additionally, its support for SSR makes it a versatile choice for projects requiring server-side rendering.
