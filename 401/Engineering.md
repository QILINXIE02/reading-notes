## Why Engineering Readings Matter

As I embark on my studies in this module, it's crucial to recognize the significance of the engineering readings provided. These readings offer valuable insights and strategies that can shape my approach to problem-solving, enhance my mindset, and ultimately contribute to my success in the field.

### Act like you make $1000/hr:

emphasizes the importance of valuing one's time and prioritizing tasks accordingly. By adopting a mindset that treats every hour as valuable, I can focus on high-impact activities and maximize productivity.

### How to think like a programmer

delves into the mindset and problem-solving strategies employed by successful programmers. Understanding how to approach challenges systematically and think critically is essential for navigating complex coding tasks effectively.

### Solving Problems

provide frameworks or methodologies for approaching and solving problems methodically. Learning how to break down issues, identify root causes, and implement effective solutions is invaluable in any engineering field.

### The 5 Whys

involves asking "why" repeatedly to get to the root cause of a problem. Mastering this technique can help uncover deeper issues behind surface-level problems, leading to more effective problem-solving and prevention of recurring issues.

### The Super Mario Effect

reframes failure as a natural part of learning and progress. Embracing setbacks as opportunities for growth and resilience can foster a positive mindset and ultimately lead to greater success in overcoming challenges.

## Discussion Questions 
1. One thing I bring to this career is my passion for the work I do and my perseverance on difficult and time-consuming tasks are invaluable assets that set me apart from others in my career. This dedication and determination to succeed can greatly benefit both me and my potential employer, as it demonstrates my commitment to excellence and my willingness to overcome challenges.

2. Three strategies I will start doing to "un-stick" myself when facing tough coding, logic, or feature challenges, my approach reflects a positive mindset and proactive problem-solving attitude:
Viewing hurdles as learning opportunities: This mindset shift allows me  to approach challenges with curiosity and a desire to deepen my understanding. By reframing obstacles as chances for growth, I am more likely to tackle them with enthusiasm and perseverance.
Practicing gratitude for challenges: Recognizing challenges as essential for personal and professional growth fosters resilience and a positive outlook. Embracing difficulties as opportunities for development can help me maintain motivation and perspective when facing setbacks.
Seeking support and collaboration: Acknowledging that I am not alone in facing challenges and leveraging the knowledge and experiences of my peers can be incredibly beneficial. Collaborating with others not only helps I find solutions faster but also fosters a sense of community and shared learning.
