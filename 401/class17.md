# Readings: AWS: S3 and Lambda

## AWS S3

- **What is Amazon S3?**: Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable object storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows users to store and retrieve data over the internet using a web services interface.
- **Use Cases for Amazon S3**:
  1. Data backup and archiving.
  2. Hosting static websites and assets.
  3. Storing application data and media files.

- **Benefits of Using Amazon S3**:
  1. Scalability: S3 can scale to accommodate any amount of data.
  2. Durability: Data stored in S3 is highly durable and redundant.
  3. Accessibility: S3 provides reliable and low-latency access to stored data.

## AWS Lambda Basics

- **What is AWS Lambda?**: AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service provided by AWS. It allows users to run code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda functions are triggered by events and automatically scale to handle incoming requests.

- **Use Cases for AWS Lambdas**:
  1. Processing data streams and logs.
  2. Building serverless web applications.
  3. Implementing backend services for IoT devices.

- **Serverless Explanation**: Serverless computing refers to the execution of code in a cloud environment where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure. Developers focus on writing code (functions) that respond to events, and the cloud provider takes care of scaling, maintenance, and infrastructure management.

## CDN

- **What is a CDN?**: A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers strategically located across the globe. It caches and delivers content to users based on their geographic location, reducing latency and improving website performance.
- **How Does a CDN Work with Website Visitors?**: When a user requests content from a website, the CDN delivers the content from the server closest to the user's location, reducing the distance the data must travel and improving load times.
- **Benefits of Employing a CDN**:
  1. Faster load times: Content is delivered from servers closer to the user, reducing latency.
  2. Scalability: CDNs can handle spikes in traffic without impacting website performance.
  3. Improved reliability: CDNs provide redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure content availability.

## Reflection

After reading and reviewing the class README, my learning goals include gaining a deeper understanding of AWS services such as S3 and Lambda, as well as exploring practical use cases and best practices for leveraging these services in real-world applications.
