## Reading

### An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

- **How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?**
  - Node.js is a platform built on JavaScript that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side, enabling you to build scalable and high-performance web applications.

- **What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?**
  - It means that Node.js provides an environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser, allowing you to run JavaScript on servers, desktops, or even IoT devices.

- **What is Node used for?**
  - Node.js is used for building server-side applications, APIs, web servers, real-time applications, and more. It is particularly well-suited for building scalable and asynchronous applications.

## Additional Questions

- **Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?**
  - I look forward to diving deeper into Node.js concepts such as event-driven programming, asynchronous programming, and building RESTful APIs.

- **What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**
  - My learning goals include gaining a solid understanding of Node.js fundamentals, learning best practices for building Node.js applications, and becoming proficient in using Node.js to build server-side applications.

## Things I want to know more about

- Asynchronous programming in Node.js
- Express.js framework for building web applications
