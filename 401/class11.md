# Readings: Event Driven Applications

## Introduction

Event-driven programming is a paradigm where the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, sensor outputs, or messages from other programs. In Node.js, event-driven programming is facilitated by the EventEmmiter module.

## Reading

### Event Driven Programming

- The native Node.js module that allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming is called `events`.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) complements Event Driven Programming by providing a structured way to organize and encapsulate the code, making it more modular and maintainable.
- In the context of backend development with Node.js, Event Driven Programming allows the server to efficiently handle multiple concurrent connections and respond to various events such as incoming requests, file system events, or database queries.

### Additional Questions

- Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, I'm looking forward to diving deeper into advanced topics such as authentication, security, and performance optimization.
- After reading and reviewing the class README, my learning goals include mastering the concepts and best practices of event-driven programming, understanding how to effectively utilize event emitters and listeners, and applying event-driven architecture in real-world Node.js applications.
