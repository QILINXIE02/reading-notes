# Reading: Authorization/Authentication

## Introduction

This reading focuses on understanding authentication and authorization concepts, along with reviewing lab requirements related to building API and Auth servers.

## Readings

### Lab Requirements

Today's lab requirements entail spending one lab session working on a project, with the possibility of additional time if needed. The due date will be provided in class, and project ideas will be discussed with a partner.

### Project Ideas

1. **User Authentication System**: Develop a user authentication system that allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. Implement features such as email verification, password reset, and role-based access control.

2. **Secure API Development**: Build an API server with secure authentication and authorization mechanisms. Implement JWT-based authentication and role-based access control to protect sensitive endpoints and data.

## Bookmark and Review

### API Server Build

Review the process of building an API server, including setting up routes, handling requests, and interacting with databases. Pay attention to security considerations and best practices for building robust and scalable APIs.

### Auth Server Build

Review the steps involved in building an authentication server, focusing on implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms. Understand the role of sessions, tokens, and middleware in securing web applications.

## Reflection

After reading and reviewing the class README on Authorization/Authentication, my learning goals include gaining a deeper understanding of:

- The differences between authentication and authorization.
- Best practices for implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Practical aspects of building API and Auth servers, including handling user sessions, managing tokens, and protecting sensitive endpoints.
