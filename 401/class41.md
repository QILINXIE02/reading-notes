# Reading: React Native

In this reading, we explore React Native, a framework for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React. Let's delve into the details:

## Getting Started with React Native

### Name three Core Components of React Native and describe what they do.
1. **View**: Similar to `<div>` in web development, the View component is a container for other components and provides layout and styling capabilities.
2. **Text**: Represents text content in the app and supports basic styling options like font size, color, and alignment.
3. **Image**: Allows the display of images in the app and provides options for specifying image sources and dimensions.

### What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)?
React Native allows developers to build mobile apps using JavaScript and React while still providing a native-like user experience. It solves the problem of developing separate codebases for iOS and Android by enabling code sharing between platforms.

### What are the building blocks of a React Native app? How does that compare to a React app?
The building blocks of a React Native app include components, navigation, state management, and API integrations. While React Native shares many concepts with React, it also includes native components and APIs specific to mobile development, such as `ScrollView`, `StatusBar`, and `AsyncStorage`.

## Expo

### What solution does expo provide?
Expo provides a set of tools and services for simplifying React Native development, including a development environment, a client app for testing, and a set of pre-built components and APIs.

### Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the ____ workflow.
Expo is often referred to as the "managed" workflow because it abstracts away much of the configuration and setup required for building React Native apps.

### What is the difference between React Native and Expo?
React Native is the framework itself, providing the core infrastructure for building mobile apps, while Expo is a set of additional tools and services built on top of React Native to streamline the development process.

## Expo Snack

### Checkout this tool. What does snack allow you to do?
Expo Snack is an online tool that allows developers to write and test React Native code directly in the browser. It provides a convenient way to experiment with React Native components and APIs without setting up a local development environment.

## Ejecting

### What does “eject” mean within the context of Expo?
"Ejecting" in the context of Expo refers to the process of converting an Expo-managed project into a standard React Native project. This exposes the underlying native code and configurations, allowing for more customization but also increasing complexity.

### When should you not eject? Why might you choose to eject?
You should avoid ejecting if you prefer to leverage Expo's managed workflow and want to benefit from its simplified development experience. However, you might choose to eject if you require access to native modules or need more control over the build process.

## Tutorial: React Native Basics

The tutorial likely covers fundamental concepts and hands-on exercises for building React Native apps. Takeaways may include understanding how to set up a React Native project, create components, handle navigation, and interact with device APIs.

## Additional Questions

### Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?
I look forward to learning more about advanced React Native topics such as navigation patterns, state management solutions, and performance optimization techniques.

### What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
After reading and reviewing the class README, my learning goals include mastering the basics of React Native development, understanding the integration of React Native with native modules and APIs, and exploring best practices for building high-quality mobile apps.
