# Reading: Bearer Authorization

## Introduction

This reading delves into Bearer Authorization, focusing on JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and their usage in securing web applications.

## Intro to JWT

### JSON Web Token (JWT)

A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact and self-contained mechanism for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
It is commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications.

### Usage of JWTs

JWTs are typically used when:
- Implementing stateless authentication mechanisms.
- Providing single sign-on (SSO) across multiple domains or services.
- Securing APIs and ensuring the integrity of transmitted data.

### Structural Components of a JWT

Claims, which represent pieces of information about the entity (user) and additional metadata, are expected in the payload component of a JWT.

### Security of JWTs

While JWTs are secure when used correctly, simply being able to decode the payload of a JWT does not make it insecure.
To ensure security, both the sender and receiver must know the secret key used to sign and verify the JWT.

## JWTs Explained

### Benefits of JWTs

JWTs are compact and self-contained, meaning all necessary information is contained within the token itself.
This makes them easy to transmit over HTTP headers and suitable for use in stateless communication.

### Components of a JWT Signature

The JWT signature consists of three components:
1. Header: Contains metadata about the type of token and the signing algorithm.
2. Payload: Contains the claims and additional information about the entity.
3. Signature: A cryptographic signature generated by combining the encoded header, encoded payload, and a secret key.

## Reflection

After reading about Bearer Authorization and JWTs, my learning goals include mastering the implementation of JWT-based authentication and authorization in web applications.
I aim to explore the npm jsonwebtoken library documentation and gain hands-on experience in securely implementing JWTs in my projects.
