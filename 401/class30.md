# Implementation: Hash Tables

## Introduction to Hash Tables

A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It offers fast insertion, deletion, and retrieval of data by mapping keys to values using a hash function. Here's a breakdown of how hash tables work:

### Why Hash Tables?

Hash tables are efficient for handling large amounts of data and provide constant-time average-case complexity for key operations like insertion, deletion, and lookup.

### What are Hash Tables?

A hash table consists of an array of slots, where each slot can hold a key-value pair. The hash function takes a key as input and computes an index (hash code) where the corresponding value should be stored.

### How Hash Tables Work?

1. **Hashing**: The key is passed through a hash function, which converts it into an index.
2. **Collision Handling**: If multiple keys hash to the same index (collision), different collision resolution techniques can be used, such as chaining (linked lists) or open addressing (probing).
3. **Insertion**: The key-value pair is inserted into the hash table at the computed index.
4. **Retrieval**: To retrieve a value, the key is hashed again, and the corresponding index is accessed to fetch the value.
5. **Deletion**: Deleting a key involves finding its index and removing the associated key-value pair.
