# Readings: Event Driven Architecture

## Introduction

Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a design pattern used in software development for building scalable and loosely coupled systems. It emphasizes the communication between different components of an application through events.

### Lab Requirements

- The lab requirements specify spending a session working on a project related to event-driven architecture. Additional time may be available, and the due date will be provided in class.
- Two possible project ideas that could be completed within the allotted time could include building a real-time chat application using Socket.io or implementing a system for order processing and delivery tracking using event-driven microservices architecture.

## Reflection

After reading and reviewing the class README, my learning goals include gaining a deeper understanding of event-driven architecture principles, learning how to implement event-driven systems using technologies like Node.js and Socket.io, and mastering the design and implementation of scalable and resilient applications based on event-driven patterns.
