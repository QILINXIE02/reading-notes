# Implementation: Stacks and Queues

## Introduction

This reading focuses on understanding the implementation of stacks and queues, fundamental data structures used in computer science and programming.

## Readings

### Stacks and Queues

**Stacks**:
- Stacks follow the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed.
- Common operations on stacks include push (adding an element to the top) and pop (removing the top element).
- An analogy for stacks is a stack of plates, where you can only add or remove plates from the top.

**Queues**:
- Queues follow the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first one to be removed.
- Common operations on queues include enqueue (adding an element to the back) and dequeue (removing the front element).
- An analogy for queues is a line of people waiting for a ticket, where the person who arrived first gets served first.

### Implementation

- Stacks and queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
- Arrays offer constant-time access to elements but may require resizing if the capacity is exceeded.
- Linked lists offer dynamic memory allocation but require traversal for access.

## Reflection

After reading about the implementation of stacks and queues, it's essential to understand:
- How to choose the appropriate data structure based on the problem requirements.
- The trade-offs between array-based and linked list-based implementations.
- Practical applications of stacks and queues in algorithms and real-world scenarios.
