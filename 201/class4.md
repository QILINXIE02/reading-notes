## Learn HTML - Creating Hyperlinks


To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside the `<a>` element.

The href attribute contains the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) or web address to which the link points. It specifies the destination of the link.

To ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers, you can:

Provide descriptive and meaningful link text that conveys the purpose of the link.
Use semantic HTML to indicate the type of content linked to (e.g., using appropriate heading tags).
Ensure that link text has enough contrast with the background for readability.
Avoid using "click here" or other non-descriptive link text.
Add title attributes to provide additional information about the link.
Test your website with screen readers and other accessibility tools.
CSS Layout - Normal Flow and Positioning
"Normal flow" in CSS refers to the default layout behavior of HTML elements. Elements are positioned vertically in the order they appear in the HTML source, and they flow from top to bottom within their parent container.

Differences between block-level and inline elements:

Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width of their parent container (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`).
Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary (e.g., `<span>`, `<a>`).
"Static" positioning is the default for every HTML element. Elements with static positioning are placed in the normal flow of the document and are not affected by top, right, bottom, or left properties.

Advantages of using absolute positioning:

Precise control over an element's placement on the page.
Elements can overlap, creating complex layouts.
Elements can be positioned relative to a parent container with a non-static position.
The key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning is that fixed positioning is relative to the viewport (the browser window) and does not move when the page is scrolled. Absolute positioning is relative to the nearest positioned ancestor, and it moves with the scrolling of that ancestor.

Learn JS - Functions - Reusable Blocks of Code
Function Declaration vs. Function Invocation:

Function Declaration defines a function and its name. It doesn't execute the function but makes it available for later use.
Function Invocation (also called a function call) is when you actually run or use the function, providing any required arguments.
A parameter is a variable in a function definition, while an argument is the actual value or expression passed into a function when it's invoked. Parameters act as placeholders for the arguments.
