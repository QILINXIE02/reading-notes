# Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

## Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

Developers might use local storage for a web application for various reasons, including:

- **Persistent Data**: Local storage allows data to be stored on the client-side, persisting across sessions and page refreshes.

- **Improved Performance**: Storing data locally can reduce the need for frequent server requests, leading to faster response times.

- **Offline Capabilities**: Local storage can enable web apps to work offline by caching essential data.

- **Reduced Bandwidth Usage**: Storing data on the client-side can reduce server load and bandwidth usage.

## What information should not be stored in local storage?

Sensitive and critical information should not be stored in local storage. This includes:

- **User Credentials**: Avoid storing usernames, passwords, or authentication tokens in local storage.

- **Sensitive Personal Data**: Social Security numbers, credit card information, and other sensitive personal information should not be stored.

- **Large Amounts of Data**: Local storage is limited in size, so avoid storing large amounts of data that could slow down the application.

## Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

Local storage can store data in the form of strings. To store other data types (e.g., objects, arrays), you can convert them to strings using methods like `JSON.stringify()`:

const data = { key: 'value' };
localStorage.setItem('myData', JSON.stringify(data));
