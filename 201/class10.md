## Troubleshooting JavaScript

### Syntax Error vs. Logic Error

1. **Syntax Error:**
   - **Definition:** Syntax errors occur when your code violates the grammatical rules of the JavaScript language. These errors prevent the code from being executed.
   - **Example:** Missing a closing parenthesis or semicolon, using undefined variables, or having an extra curly brace.
   - **Identification:** Syntax errors are usually caught by the JavaScript interpreter and displayed in the console with specific error messages.
   - **Correction:** Correcting syntax errors involves fixing the code to adhere to the language's grammar rules.

2. **Logic Error:**
   - **Definition:** Logic errors, also known as semantic errors, occur when the code is syntactically correct but does not produce the expected output due to flawed logic or incorrect algorithm.
   - **Example:** An incorrect formula in a mathematical calculation, a misplaced conditional statement, or improper data manipulation.
   - **Identification:** Identifying logic errors often requires debugging and careful examination of the code's behavior.
   - **Correction:** Correcting logic errors involves analyzing the code's logic, finding the problem areas, and modifying the logic to produce the desired outcome.

### Past Lab Assignment Errors

In past lab assignments, I encountered various errors, including:

1. **Undefined Variable Error:**
   - **Issue:** Attempting to use a variable that was not defined.
   - **Resolution:** Declared the variable and assigned it a value before using it.

2. **Syntax Error:**
   - **Issue:** use "_" instead of ``for arrays
   - **Resolution:** Reviewed my mistake and ensure they were correct

### Long-Term Influence

Understanding how to troubleshoot JavaScript effectively will be my long-term goals as a software developer. Things such as Writing reliable and maintainable code, reducing development time and debugging efforts, and Collaborating with other developers to identify and fix issues are my priorities

## The JavaScript Debugger

### 1. JavaScript Debugger Tool

The JavaScript Debugger is a development tool that helps developers identify and resolve issues in their JavaScript code. It allows you to:

- **Pause Execution:**  pauses the code's execution at specific points to inspect its state.
- **Inspect Variables:** views the current values of variables to understand how they change.
- **Step Through Code:** steps through the code line by line to track its flow.
- **Set Breakpoints:** Breakpoints are markers in the code where execution stops for inspection.
- **Call Stack:** provides information about the sequence of function calls.

### 2. Breakpoint

A breakpoint is a designated point in your code where you want the execution to pause for inspection. It is useful for pinpointing the root of errors or understanding how your code executes.

### 3. Call Stack

The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the function calls in your code. When a function is called, it's pushed onto the stack, and when it returns, it's popped off the stack.
