###Reponse of reading assignment: 
How the Web Works:
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) sends data between computers, allowing them to request and share information. It operates on a client-server model, where the client (usually a web browser) makes requests to servers to retrieve web pages and other resources.

Website Design and Process:
Website design involves planning, creating layouts, selecting colors, fonts, and images. The process includes wireframing, designing mockups, coding, and testing the website.

JavaScript Basics:
JavaScript is a programming language for the web. It is used for enhancing website interactivity. Comments in JavaScript are notes that are ignored by the browser and help developers add explanations to their code.

Poem on HTTP:
HTTP, the web's connection thread,
Data travels through it, as it's said.
Requests from clients to servers flow,
Information back and forth they go.

Parsing HTML, CSS, and JS:
HTML, CSS, and JS files are parsed by the browser in the following way: HTML creates the Document Object Model (DOM), CSS styles the DOM elements, and JS can manipulate the DOM and add functionality.

Finding Images for a Website:
You can find images for a website through online image libraries, stock photo websites, creating your own, or using open-source image resources.

Creating String vs. Number in JavaScript:
In JavaScript, you can create a string by enclosing text in single or double quotes, and you can create a number by writing a numeric value without quotes.

Variables in JavaScript:
A variable is a container for storing data in JavaScript. They are crucial for storing and managing information in your code.

HTML Attributes:
HTML attributes are additional information added to HTML elements to provide extra details or functionality. They are written as name-value pairs within an element's opening tag.

Anatomy of an HTML Element:
An HTML element consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. For example:` <p>` This is a paragraph. `</p>`

`<article>`  vs. `<section>` :
`<article>` is used for self-contained, independent content (like a news article), while `<section>` is used for grouping related content within a document.

Typical Website Elements:
A typical website includes elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, navigation menus, forms, and more.

Metadata and SEO:
Metadata influences Search Engine Optimization (SEO) by providing information about the content of a web page, helping search engines understand and rank the page.

`<meta>` Tag for Metadata:
The `<meta>` HTML tag is used to specify metadata, such as character encoding, viewport settings, and descriptions, in the `<head> `of an HTML document.

Starting Website Design:
The first step in designing a website is to define the purpose, target audience, and goals of the site.

Important Website Design Question:
The most important question to answer when designing a website is, "What do you want to achieve with this website?"

Using h1 heading over the `<span>` tag:
The h1 heading is used for top-level headings because it carries semantic meaning, aiding accessibility and SEO. `<span>` is a generic inline element.

Benefits of Semantic Tags:
Using semantic HTML tags improves website accessibility, SEO, and makes the code more understandable and maintainable.

JavaScript in the Browser:
JavaScript is required for tasks like form validation and interactive elements on web pages, such as image sliders or interactive forms.

Adding JavaScript to HTML:
JavaScript can be added to an HTML document within the script tags either in the `<head>` or at the end of the `<body>`.
