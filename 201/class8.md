# Learn CSS - Flexbox

## Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
- Flexbox is primarily meant for arranging and aligning content in a single direction. It focuses on managing the layout of elements along either the horizontal (main axis) or vertical (cross axis) axis, but not both at the same time.

## Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
- The main axis is the primary axis along which flex items are arranged. It's defined by the `flex-direction` property and can be either horizontal or vertical. The cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis. The main axis and cross axis are used for positioning and alignment of flex items within a flex container.

## How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
- Using properties like `order` to rearrange elements visually can disrupt the natural flow of content for screen readers. It may also lead to a non-sequential reading order, which can be confusing for users who rely on assistive technologies. Additionally, improper use of flexbox properties may create inaccessible layouts that are difficult for all users to navigate.
