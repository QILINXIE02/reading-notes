# Reading CSS Transforms

## What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?

A CSS transform allows a developer to apply various visual transformations to an HTML element, including:

- **Translation**: Moving an element along the X and Y axes.
- **Rotation**: Rotating an element by a specified angle.
- **Scaling**: Resizing an element, making it larger or smaller.
- **Skewing**: Distorting an element along the X or Y axis.

## Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.

Here's an example of rotating an element by 45 degrees using CSS transform:

`css
.rotate-example {
  transform: rotate(45deg);
}`

# CSS Transitions & Animations

## How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?

CSS animations differ from CSS transitions in that animations allow for more complex and customized animations, including keyframes, multiple property animations, and more, without the need for user interaction.
